# Problem Statement

**X**

Write a program that, given an odd integer, N, in [3, 23], draws a box
(out of * characters) of height N and width N with an X in the middle. That is,
the diagonals of the box should be drawn with * characters.

For example, 5 should give you:
```
*****  
** **  
* * *  
** **  
*****
```
And an input of 7 should give you:
```
*******
**   **  
* * * *
*  *  *
* * * *
**   **
*******
```
You may include additional header files as needed, and you may call any
functions you'd like.

**Input Format**

An integer N that may be odd or even, and may or may not be in [3, 23].

**Constraints**

N will be an integer.

**Output Format**

A box with diagonals, drawn from * characters, provided N is odd and in [3, 23].
If N is even or is not in [3, 23], your program should not print anything.

**Sample Input**
```
5
```
**Sample Output**
```
*****  
** **  
* * *  
** **  
*****
```
