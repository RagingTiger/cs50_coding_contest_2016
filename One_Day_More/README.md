# Problem Statement

**One Day More**

Write a program that, given a year, Y, as an integer via standard input, prints
via standard output Leap Year if Y is a leap year, and Not Leap Year if Y is not
a leap year.

Recall that:

A year is a leap year if it is a multiple of four (2004, 2008, and 2012 are all
leap years). The exception to this rule is that a year which is a multiple of
100 and also not a multiple of 400 is not a leap year. For example, 1800 and
1900 are not leap years, but 2000 is a leap year (because it is a multiple of
400).

You may include additional header files as needed, and you may call any
functions you'd like.

Odds are, you'll find GetInt of interest!
